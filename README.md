# Oregon Trail PHP

The rules are:
* Any language (except the original BASIC or PC-Basic) allowed
* Result should match the original as closely as possible

And here is the challenge:
Take the source-code from the game "The Oregon Trail" and convert it into a language of your choice.

The source code that acts as reference for this project is [here](http://www.filfre.net/misc/oregon1975.bas).

The purpose of this Programming Prompt is to learn how to read and work with legacy code (in a language you probably don't know) and to convert this code into a more modern language.
